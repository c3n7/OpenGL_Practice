# Shaders
## GLSL
- Shaders always begin with a version declaration, followed by a list of input and output variables, uniforms and its main function(the entry point)
- A shader typically has the following structure
```c++
#version version_number
in type in_variable_name;
in type in_variable_name;

out type out_variable_name;

uniform type uniform_name;

void main()
{
    // Process input(s) and do some weird graphics stuff
    // ...
    out_variable_name = weird_stuff_we_processed;
}
```

- In **vertex shaders**, each input variable is also known as a `vertex attribute`.
- There is a maximum number of vertex attributes we are allowed to declare limited by the hardware.
- OpenGL guarantees there are always 16 4-component vertex attributes available, but some hardware might allow for more which you can retreive by querying `GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS`:
```c++
int nrAttributes;
glGetIntegerv(GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS, &nrAttributes);
std::cout << "Maximum nr of vertex attributes supported: " << nrAttributes << std::endl;
```

### Types
GLSL has these types among others:
1. int
2. float
3. double
4. uint
5. bool.  

GLSL also features two container types:
1. vectors
2. matrices

#### Vectors
A vector in GLSL is a 1, 2, 3, or 4 component container for any of the basic types mentioned above. They can take the following form ( **n** being the number of components):
1. **vecn**: the default vector of n floats.
2. **bvecn**: a vector of n booleans.
3. **ivecn**: a vector of n integers.
4. **uvecn**: a vector of n unsigned integers.
5. **dvecn**: a vector of n double components.

- Components of a vector can be accessed via **vec.x** etc. You can use **.x**, **.y**, **.z**, and **.w** to access their first, second, third and fourth component  respectively.
- GLSL also allows you to use **rgba** for colors or **stpq** for texture coordinates, accessing the same components.
- The vector data type allows for flexible component selection called **swizzling** which allows for the following syntax:
```GLSL
vec2 someVec;
vec4 differentVec = someVec.xyxx;
vec3 anotherVec = differentVec.zyw;
vec4 otherVec = someVec.xxxx + anotherVec.yxzy;
```
- You can use any combination of up to 4 letters to create a new vector (of the same type) as long as the original vector has those components; it is not allowed to access the .z component of a vec2 for example.
- We can also pass vectors as arguments to different vector constructor calls, reduing the number of arguments required:
```GLSL
vec2 vect = vec2(0.5, 0.7);
vec4 result = vec4(vect, 0.0, 0.0);
vec4 otherResult = vec4(result.xyz, 1.0);
```

### Ins and outs
- GLSL defined the `in` and `out` keywords specifically for moving data in and out of shaders.
- The vertex shader should receive some form of input otherwise it would be pretty ineffective. The vertex shader differs in its input, in that it receives its input straight from the vertex data.
- To define how the vertex data is organized, we specify the input variables with location metadata so we can configure the vertex attributes on the CPU (`layout (location = 0`).
- The vertex shader thus requires an extra layout specification for its inputs so we can link it with the vertex data.
    - **Note**
    - It is also possible to omit the `layout (location = 0)` specifier and query for the attribute locations in your OpenGl code via `glGetAttribLocation`, but setting them in the vertex shader makes it easier to understand and saves you (and OpenGL) some work.
    - **End Note**
- The other exception is that the fragment shader requires a **vec4** color output variable so to generate a final output color. Failure to specify an output color in the fragment shader will result in OpenGL rendering your object black(or white).
- To send data from one shader to the next in the pipeline, we'd have to declare an output variable in the sending shader and a similar input in the receiving shader.
- When the types and the names are equal on both sides, OpenGL will link those variables together and then it is possible to send data between shaders (this is done when linking a program object
For example
    - **Vertex Shader**
        ```c++
        #version 330 core
        layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPos; // The position variable has attribute position 0

        out vec4 vertexColor; // Specify a color output to the fragment shader

        void main()
        {
            gl_Position = vec4(aPos, 1.0); // See how we directly give a vec3 to vec4's constructor
            vertexColor = vec4(0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0); // Set the output variable to a dark-red color
        }
        ```
    - **Fragment Shader**
        ```c++
        #version 330 core
        out vec4 FragColor;

        in vec4 vertexColor; // The input variable from the vertex shader (same name and same type)

        void main()
        {
            FragColor = vertexColor;
        }
        ```

### Uniforms
- These are another way to pass data from our application on the CPU to the shaders on the GPU, but uniforms are slightly different compared to vertex attributes.
- First of all, uniforms are **global** in that a uniform variable is unique per shader program object, and can be accessed from any shader at any stage in the shader program.
- Second, whatever you set the uniform value to, uniforms will keep their values until they're either reset or updated.
- To declare a uniform in GLSL we simply ad the **uniform** keyword to a shader with a type and a name:
    ```c++
    #version 330 core
    out vec4 FragColor

    uniform vec4 ourColor; // We set this variable in the OpenGL code.

    void main()
    {
        FragColor = ourColor;
    }
    ```
- Since uniforms are global variables, we can define them in any shader we'd like so no need to go through the vertex shader again to get something to the fragment shader.
- We are not using this uniform in the vertex shader so there's no need to define it there.
    - **Note**
    - If you declare a uniform that isn't used anywhere in your GLSL code, the compiler will silently remove the variable from the compiled version.  
    - **End Note**
- To add data to the uniform, we first need to find the index/location of the uniform.
- Lets us use the uniform to change the color over time:
    ```c++
    float timeValue = glfwGetTime();
    float greenValue = (sin(timeValue) / 2.0f) + 0.5f;
    int vertexColorLocation = glGetUniformLocation(shaderProgram, "ourColor");
    glUseProgram(shaderProgram);
    glUniform4f(vertexColorLocation, 0.0f, greenValue, 0.0f, 1.0f);
    ```
- First, we retrieve the running time in seconds via `glfwGetTime()`. Then we vary the color in the range of 0.0 - 1.0 by using the `sin` function and store the result in `greenValue`.
- We then query for the location of the `ourColor` uniform(that we want to retreive the location from) to the query function.
- If `glGetUniformLocation` returns -1, it could not find the location.
- Lastly, we can set the uniform value using the `glUniform4f` function.
- Not that finding the uniform location does not require you to use the shader program first, but updating a uniform **does require** you to first use the program, because it sets the uniform on the currently active shader program.
    - **Note**
    - Since OpenGL is in its core a C library, it does not have native support for type overloading, so wherever a function can be called with different types, OpenGL defines new function for each type required; `glUnifrom` is an example of this. The function requires a postfix for the type of the uniform you want to set. A few of the possible postfixes are
        - `f`: the function expects a `float` as its value.
        - `i`: the function expects an `int` as its value.
        - `ui`: the function expects an `unsigned int` as its value.
        - `3f`: the function expects 3 `floats` as its value.
        - `fv`: the function expects a `float` vector/array as its value.
    - Whenever you want to conigure an option of OpenGL simply pick the overloaded function that corresponds with your type.In our case, we want to set 4 floats of the uniform individually so we pass our data via `glUniform4f`. (note that we also could've used the fv version.
    - **End Note**
- We update this uniform every game loop iteration so that the color changes per-frame.
    ```c++
    while(!glfwWindowShouldClose(window))
    {
        // Input
        processInput(window);

        // Render
        // 1. Clear the buffer
        glClearColor(0.2f, 0.3f, 0.3f, 1.0f);
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

        // 2. Be sure to activate the shader
        glUseProgram(shaderProgram);

        // Update the uniform color
        float timeValue = glfwGetTime();
        float greenValue = sin(timeValue) / 2.0f + 0.5f;
        int vertexColorLocation = glGetUniformLocation(shaderProgram, "ourColor");
        glUniform4f(vertexColorLocation, 0.0f, greenValue, 0.0f, 1.0f);

        // 3. Now render the triangle
        glBindVertexArray(VAO);
        glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3);

        // Swap the buffers and poll IO events
        glfwSwapBuffers(window);
        glfwPollEvents();
    }
    ```
- Uniforms are useful for setting attributes that might change in each render iteration but when we want to change the color of each vertex, we'd have to declare as many unifroms as we have vertices.
- A better solution would be to include more data in the vertex attributes.

### More Attributes
- Let us add color data to the vertex data.
    ```c++
    float vertices[] = {
        // positions	// colors
        0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f,	1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,   // Bottom right
        -0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f,   // Bottom left
        0.0f, 0.5f, 0.0f,	0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f   // Top
    };
    ```
- Lets know adjust the vertex shader to also receive our color value as a vertex attribute input.
- Note that we set the location of the `aColor` attribute to 1 with the layout specifier:
    ```c++
    #version 330 core
    layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPos;	// The position variable has attribute position 0
    layout (location = 1) in vec3 aColor;	// The color variable has attribute position 1

    out vec3 ourColor; // Output a color to the fragment shader

    void main()
    {
        gl_Position = vec4(aPos, 1.0);
        ourColor = aColor; // Set ourColor to the inout color we got from the vertex data
    }
    ```
- Let us now update the fragment shader accordingly
    ```c++
    #version 330 core
    out vec4 FragColor;
    in vec3 ourColor;

    void main()
    {
        FragColor = vec4(ourColor, 1.0);
    }
    ```
- Now we re-configure the vertex attribute pointers
    ```c++
    // position attribute
    glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 6 * sizeof(float), (void*)0);
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
    // Color attribute
    glVertexAttribPointer(1, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 6 * sizeof(float), (void*)(3 * sizeof(float));
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(1);
    ```

- The **stride** is now 6 floats, and the offset for the color data is 3 floats.

## Portable Shader Class
- Let's start by adding the required includes and by defining the class structure:
    ```c++
    #ifndef SHADER_H
    #define SHADER_H

    #include <glad/glad.h> // Include this to get all the required OpenGL headers

    #include <string>
    #include <fstream>
    #include <sstream>
    #include <iostream>

    class Shader {
    public:
        // the program ID
        unsigned int Program;

        // constructor reads and builds the shader
        Shader(const GLchar* vertexPath, const GLchar* fragmentPath);
        // use/activate the shader
        void use();
        // utility uniform functions
        void setBool(const std::string &name, bool value) const;
        void setInt(const std::string &name, int value) const;
        void setFloat(const std::string &name, float value) const;
    };

    #endif
    ```
### Reading from a file
- We are using C++ filestreams to read the content from the file into several `string` objects:
    ```c++
    Shader(const char* vertexPath) {
        // 1. retrieve the vertex/fragment source code from filePath
        std::string vertexCode;
        std::string fragmentCode;
        std::ifstream vShaderFile;
        std::ifstream fShaderFile;
        // ensure ifstream objects can throw exceptions
        vShaderFile.exceptions (std::ifstream::failbit | std::ifstream::badbit);
        fShaderFile.exceptions (std::ifstream::failbit | std::ifstream::badbit);

        try {
            // open files
            vShaderFile.open(vertexPath);
            fShaderFile.open(fragmentPath);
            std::stringstream vShaderStream, fShaderStream;
            // read file's buffer contents into streams
            vShaderStream << vShaderFile.rdbuf();
            fShaderStream << fShaderFile.rdbuf();
            // close file handlers
            vShaderFile.close();
            fShaderFile.close();
            // convert stream into string
            vertexCode = vShaderStream.str();
            fragmentCode = fShaderStream.str();
        }
        catch(std::ifstream::failure e) {
            std::cout << "ERROR::SHADER::FILE_NOT_SUCCESFULLY_READ" << std::endl;
        }
        const char* vShaderCode = vertexCode.c_str();
        const char* fShaderCode = fragmentCode.c_str();
        // [...]
    ```
- Now compile and link the shaders
    ```c++
        // 2. compile the shaders
        unsigned int vertex, fragment;
        int success;
        char infoLog[512];

        // vertex shader
        vertex = glCreateShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER);
        glShaderSource(vertex, 1, &vShaderCode, NULL);
        glCompileShader(vertex)
        // print compile errors if any
        glGetShaderiv(vertex, GL_COMPILE_STATUS, &success);
        if (!success) {
            glGetShaderInfoLog(vertex, 512, NULL, infoLog);
            std::cout << "ERROR::SHADER::VERTEX::COMPILATION_FAILED\n\t" << infoLog << std::endl;
        }

        // similar for fragment shader
        [...]

        // shader program
        this->Program = glCreateProgram();
        glAttachShader(this->Program, vertex);
        glAttachShader(this->Program, fragment);
        glLinkProgram(this->Program);
        // print linking errors if any
        glGetProgramiv(this->Program, GL_LINK_STATUS, &success);
        if (!success) {
            glGetProgramInfoLog(this->Program, 512, NULL, infoLog);
            std::cout << "ERROR::SHADER::PROGRAM::LINKING_FAILED\n\t" << infoLog << std::endl;
        }

        // delete these two as they're linked and no longer needed
        glDeleteShader(vertex);
        glDeleteShader(fragment);
    ```
- The use function is simple:
    ```c++
    void use() {
        glUseProgram(Program);
    }
    ```
- As are the uniform setter functions:
    ```c++
    void setBool(const std::string &name, bool value) const {
        glUniform1i(glGetUniformLocation(Program, name.c_str()), (int)value);
    }
    void setInt(const std::string &name, int value) const {
        glUniform1i(glGetUniformLocation(Program, name.c_str()), value);
    }
    void setFloat(const std::string &name, float value) const {
        glUniform1i(glGetUniformLocation(Program, name.c_str()), value);
    }
    ```
- To use it:
    ```c++
    Shader ourShader("path/to/shaders/shader.vs", "path/to/shaders/shader.fs");
    // ...
    while(...) {
        ourShader.use();
        ourShader.setFloat("someUniform", 1.0f);
        DrawStuff();
    }
    ```

## Exercises
- Adjust the vertex shader so that the triangle is upside down.
- Specify a horizontal offset via a uniform and move the triangle to the right side of the screen in the vertex shader using this offset value.
- Output the vertex position to the fragment shader using the `out` keyword and set the fragment's color equal to this vetex position. Then answer this question, why is the bottom-left side of our triangle black.
